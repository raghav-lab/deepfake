# Deepfake Generation Project

This project is a Deepfake generator that creates realistic face-swapped videos using deep learning techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

Deepfake technology uses deep neural networks to generate synthetic media where a person’s face is replaced with someone else’s in video or images. This project demonstrates how face-swapping works using open-source libraries and models.

## 🚀 Features

- Face detection and alignment
- Face encoding and matching
- Face-swapping using GANs or autoencoders
- Video generation with swapped faces
- CLI or GUI (optional)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib or MTCNN (for face detection)
- DeepFaceLab / FaceSwap / Custom GAN
- NumPy, TensorFlow / PyTorch
